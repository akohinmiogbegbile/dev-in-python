Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step and explain each section:

1. First, we import the necessary libraries: `tkinter` for creating the GUI.

2. Next, we define the `BankAccount` class. This class represents a bank account and has attributes for storing the balance and methods for depositing and withdrawing funds.

3. The `handle_account` function is defined to handle the GUI and user interactions for a specific bank account. It takes the `account` parameter, which is an instance of the `BankAccount` class.

4. Inside the `handle_account` function, we define two nested functions: `deposit` and `withdraw`. These functions are bound to buttons and are responsible for retrieving the input values from entry fields, calling the corresponding methods on the `BankAccount` object, and updating the GUI accordingly.

5. The `main` function is where the program starts. We create the root window using `tk.Tk()`, which is the main application window.

6. Inside the `main` function, we define the `select_account` function. This function is called when a button (current or savings) is clicked. It takes the corresponding `BankAccount` object as a parameter and calls the `handle_account` function, passing the selected account.

7. Two `BankAccount` objects, `current_account` and `savings_account`, are created.

8. Next, we create the buttons for selecting the account type (`current` or `savings`). The `command` parameter of each button is set to call the `select_account` function with the respective `BankAccount` object.

9. We create a quit button that calls `root.destroy` when clicked, to exit the application.

10. Finally, we start the GUI event loop by calling `root.mainloop()`. This loop listens for user interactions and keeps the GUI responsive.

When you run the code, it will display a window with buttons for the current and savings accounts. Clicking on either button will open a new window with options for depositing and withdrawing funds. The deposit and withdrawal operations will be performed on the selected account, and the balance will be updated accordingly.

Note that this is a simplified example to demonstrate the usage of Tkinter in creating a virtual bank app. In a real-world application, you would need to handle validation, error checking, and possibly store the data persistently.
